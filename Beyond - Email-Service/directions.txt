Hello Beyond!
Happy doing bussines with you!
the following steps show how to get your email automation up and running:
1. in a folder called files you will see 3 txt files
2. email_to_be_sent and to_emails are the only ones you need to worry about.
3. open email_to_be_sent, you will see 2 lines the first line is the subject of the email that will be sent out.
the second line will be a tag !HTML then following will be a message in HTML. if you wish to switch to plain text email just
delete the !HTML part and my program will send the following message as text, like so:
subject
this is a plain text email. Hello !!name!!

TIP: if you put !!name!! in the message string it will automatically input the recipents name inplace of the !!name!!
4. open to_emails, put a list of emails in like so:
blank.blank@gmail.com
blank.blank@gmail.com
blank.blank@gmail.com
blank.blank@gmail.com

my program will parse through the emails and send the message to each adress
5. open the exe and enter your email and password (yahoo or gmail) and click change
6. finnaly click toggle sending and it will slowly send the emails (there is a progress bar to monitor the progress)
7. during sending, spam the x to stop sending emails
8. ask me for help if there is an error
